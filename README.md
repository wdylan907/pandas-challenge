Two trends:

Schools with greater than 2000 students perform much worse than those with less than 2000 students, though there is basically no difference between schools in the other two size groups. Would be worth breaking the 2000+ student group down further to see how the number of students affects performance.

More spending per student apparently correlates with worse performance. This is surprising and according to a quick Google search runs counter to other studies. Should be looked into.
